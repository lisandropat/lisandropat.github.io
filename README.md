UX/UI designer's portfolio based on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

Hi! I'm a nomad designer working remotely on innovative projects focused on UX/UI and visual experiences using multiple creative disciplines which adapt to clients proposals. If you want to get in touch with me, [visit my portfolio](https://lisandropat.github.io) or [send me an email](mailto:lisandropat@gmail.com).

*Incoming update note:* Unfortunately, due to Netlify's poor business decisions, Gatsby is on its way to disappearing. My portfolio relies on several Gatsby plugins, which are the ones most at risk. I'm tired of the corporate world money-decisions dictating the direction of the tools we use. For that reason, this project will likely be migrated to native JavaScript in the coming months, when I have time to do so.
